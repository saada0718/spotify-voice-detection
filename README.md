This project uses voice recogntion to create a spotify playlist.
When the user uses the project for the first time, the user will have to log in and give consent.
The bot will ask for the name of the playlist and the description of the playlist.
The bot will proceed to ask the songs that the user wants in the playlist.
When the user is done with providing all the songs and says 'quit' then the bot will add the songs to the playlist and end the program.
